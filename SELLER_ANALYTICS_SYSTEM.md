## Implementation Guide

### 1. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Components already created:
app/src/components/SellerAnalytics.tsx
app/src/components/ProductPerformance.tsx

# Service already created:
app/src/services/analyticsService.ts

# Types already created:
app/src/types/analytics.ts
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Routes already created:
backend/src/routes/analytics.ts

# Add to server.ts:
import analyticsRouter from './routes/analytics';
app.use('/api/analytics', analyticsRouter);
```

### 3. Database Schema

```sql
-- Analytics tables (optional, can use existing tables)

CREATE TABLE seller_metrics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  seller_id VARCHAR(44),
  period VARCHAR(20),
  metrics JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE product_performance (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id UUID,
  metrics JSONB,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE analytics_alerts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  seller_id VARCHAR(44),
  type VARCHAR(50),
  severity VARCHAR(20),
  title VARCHAR(200),
  message TEXT,
  action_url VARCHAR(500),
  dismissed_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE generated_reports (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  seller_id VARCHAR(44),
  config JSONB,
  file_url VARCHAR(500),
  file_size INTEGER,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 4. Implement Metrics Calculation

```typescript
// backend/src/services/AnalyticsService.ts

export class AnalyticsService {
  async calculateSellerMetrics(sellerId: string, period: string) {
    // Query orders, reviews, reputation cards
    // Calculate all metrics
    // Return SellerMetrics object
  }

  async calculateProductPerformance(productId: string) {
    // Query product data
    // Calculate performance score
    // Generate recommendations
    // Return ProductPerformance object
  }

  async generateAlerts(sellerId: string) {
    // Check stock levels
    // Check performance metrics
    // Check reviews
    // Generate Alert objects
  }

  async generateOptimizationSuggestions(productId: string) {
    // Analyze product data
    // Compare with competitors
    // Generate OptimizationSuggestion objects
  }
}
```

### 5. Add to Navigation

```typescript
// app/src/App.tsx or navigation component

<Route path="/analytics" element={<SellerAnalytics />} />
<Route path="/products/performance" element={<ProductPerformance />} />
```

### 6. Testing

```typescript
// Test metrics calculation
describe('AnalyticsService', () => {
  it('should calculate seller metrics correctly', async () => {
    const metrics = await analyticsService.calculateSellerMetrics('seller1', 'MONTH');
    expect(metrics.totalRevenue).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(metrics.revenueGrowth).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('should generate relevant alerts', async () => {
    const alerts = await analyticsService.generateAlerts('seller1');
    expect(alerts).toBeInstanceOf(Array);
  });
});
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Performance
- Cache frequently accessed metrics
- Use database indexes on seller_id, product_id, created_at
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Pre-calculate metrics in background jobs

### 2. Data Accuracy
- Validate all input data
- Handle edge cases (no sales, new sellers)
- Use consistent date ranges
- Account for timezone differences

### 3. User Experience
- Show loading states
- Provide helpful tooltips
- Use clear visualizations
- Enable data export

### 4. Privacy
- Only show seller's own data
- Anonymize competitor data
- Secure API endpoints
- Implement rate limiting
