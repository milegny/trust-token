## üé® Card Types

The program supports 8 types of reputation cards:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Trustworthy` | General trustworthiness |
| `QualityProducts` | High-quality items |
| `FastShipping` | Quick delivery |
| `GoodCommunication` | Responsive and clear |
| `FairPricing` | Reasonable prices |
| `Reliable` | Consistent performance |
| `Professional` | Professional conduct |
| `Responsive` | Quick to respond |

---

## üîÑ Card Status

Cards can have one of four statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Active` | Card is valid and active |
| `Revoked` | Issuer has revoked the card |
| `Disputed` | Recipient has disputed the card |
| `Suspended` | Authority has suspended the card |

---

## üß™ Testing

A comprehensive test script has been created at:
```
scripts/test-reputation-card.ts
```

### To run tests:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run test script
anchor run test-reputation-card
```

### Test Coverage:
1. ‚úÖ Program initialization
2. ‚úÖ Create reputation card
3. ‚úÖ Revoke card
4. ‚úÖ Restore card
5. ‚úÖ Dispute card
6. ‚úÖ Update card status (authority)

---

## üìä Program State

The program maintains global state with:
- **authority**: Program authority public key
- **total_cards_issued**: Counter of all cards created
- **total_cards_revoked**: Counter of currently revoked cards

### PDA Seeds:
- Program State: `["program_state"]`
- Reputation Card: `["reputation_card", issuer, recipient, card_number]`

---

## üîê Security Features

1. **Signer Verification**: All functions verify the correct signer
2. **Status Checks**: Functions validate card status before operations
3. **Input Validation**: Message and reason lengths are validated
4. **Overflow Protection**: Uses checked arithmetic for counters
5. **Authority Control**: Admin functions restricted to program authority
6. **Immutable Data**: Issuer and recipient cannot be changed after creation

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Initialize the Program
```typescript
const [programStatePDA] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [Buffer.from("program_state")],
  program.programId
);

await program.methods
  .initialize()
  .accounts({
    authority: authority.publicKey,
    programState: programStatePDA,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
  })
  .rpc();
```

### 2. Create Your First Card
```typescript
const cardType = { trustworthy: {} };
const message = "Great seller!";
const rating = 5;

await program.methods
  .createCard(cardType, message, rating)
  .accounts({
    issuer: issuer.publicKey,
    recipient: recipient.publicKey,
    programState: programStatePDA,
    reputationCard: reputationCardPDA,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
  })
  .signers([issuer])
  .rpc();
```

### 3. Integrate with Frontend
Update your frontend to use the new program ID and interact with the deployed program.

### 4. Backend Integration
Update backend services to query and record reputation cards from the blockchain.

## üìö Additional Resources

- **Program Source**: `programs/reputation_card/src/lib.rs`
- **IDL**: `target/idl/reputation_card.json`
- **Test Script**: `scripts/test-reputation-card.ts`
- **Solana Explorer**: https://explorer.solana.com/address/FmZBiFUHHtGQioU11V9asYiJGP5wDdrLqoikzAyEyRtc?cluster=devnet

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **IDL Upload**: The IDL upload failed during deployment due to program ID mismatch. This doesn't affect program functionality but means the IDL needs to be manually distributed or uploaded separately.

2. **Devnet Limitations**: Devnet is for testing only. For production, deploy to mainnet-beta.

3. **SOL Requirements**: Ensure sufficient SOL for:
   - Program deployment: ~2 SOL
   - Account creation: ~0.002 SOL per card
   - Transaction fees: ~0.000005 SOL per transaction

4. **Rate Limits**: Devnet airdrops are rate-limited. Plan accordingly for testing.

## üéâ Deployment Complete!

The ReputationCard program is now live on Solana Devnet and ready for testing and integration.

**Program ID**: `FmZBiFUHHtGQioU11V9asYiJGP5wDdrLqoikzAyEyRtc`
