# Phase 1: Soulbound TrustToken Implementation

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Soulbound Mechanism**

The TrustToken NFT is now **permanently bound** to the minter's wallet through the following mechanisms:

#### Automatic Freezing on Mint
```rust
// After minting, the token account is immediately frozen
freeze_account(freeze_cpi_context)?;
```

This prevents:
- ‚ùå Transfers to other wallets
- ‚ùå Sales on marketplaces
- ‚ùå Any movement of the token

#### Why Freezing Works
- The token account has a `freeze_authority` (set to the minter)
- Once frozen, the token cannot be transferred
- The token remains in the wallet but is immovable
- This is the standard Solana approach for soulbound tokens

### 2. **New Functions Added**

#### `verify_soulbound()`
Checks if a TrustToken is still properly bound to its original owner.

**Verifies:**
- ‚úÖ Token is in the original owner's wallet
- ‚úÖ Token account is frozen
- ‚úÖ Token amount is exactly 1

**Use Case:** Regular audits to ensure tokens haven't been compromised

#### `burn_transferred_token()`
Allows the authority to burn tokens that have been transferred (violating soulbound property).

**Security:**
- Only callable by program authority
- Requires proof that token was transferred
- Burns the token to enforce soulbound rules

**Use Case:** Emergency response if a token is somehow transferred

### 3. **New Error Codes**

```rust
TokenTransferred       // Token has been moved from original wallet
TokenNotFrozen        // Token should be frozen but isn't
InvalidTokenAmount    // Should have exactly 1 token
TokenNotTransferred   // Trying to burn a token that wasn't transferred
UnauthorizedBurn      // Only authority can burn tokens
```

## üîí How Soulbound Works

### Minting Flow

```
1. User calls mint()
   ‚Üì
2. NFT is minted to user's wallet
   ‚Üì
3. Token account is FROZEN immediately
   ‚Üì
4. TrustToken data stored (owner, mint, verified status)
   ‚Üì
5. Token is now SOULBOUND - cannot be transferred
```

### What Happens if Someone Tries to Transfer?

```
User attempts transfer
   ‚Üì
Solana checks token account
   ‚Üì
Token account is FROZEN
   ‚Üì
Transaction FAILS
   ‚Üì
Token remains in original wallet
```

### Emergency Burn (if somehow transferred)

```
Authority detects transferred token
   ‚Üì
Authority calls burn_transferred_token()
   ‚Üì
Verifies token is not in original wallet
   ‚Üì
Burns the token
   ‚Üì
Token is destroyed
```

## üìä Updated Program Structure

### Functions

| Function | Purpose | Who Can Call |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `initialize()` | Set up program | Authority (once) |
| `mint()` | Mint soulbound NFT | Anyone |
| `revoke_verification()` | Revoke verified status | Authority only |
| `restore_verification()` | Restore verified status | Authority only |
| `verify_soulbound()` | Check if token is properly bound | Anyone |
| `burn_transferred_token()` | Burn transferred tokens | Authority only |

### Account Structures

**ProgramState**
- `authority: Pubkey` - Program authority
- `total_minted: u64` - Total tokens minted

**TrustToken**
- `owner: Pubkey` - Original owner (immutable)
- `mint: Pubkey` - NFT mint address
- `is_verified: bool` - Verification status
- `minted_at: i64` - Mint timestamp

---

## üîê Security Features

### 1. **Immutable Ownership**
- Owner is set at mint time
- Cannot be changed
- Used to verify soulbound status

### 2. **Frozen Token Account**
- Prevents all transfers
- Standard Solana mechanism
- Cannot be unfrozen by user

### 3. **Authority Controls**
- Only authority can revoke/restore verification
- Only authority can burn transferred tokens
- Authority set at initialization

### 4. **Verification Checks**
- `verify_soulbound()` ensures token integrity
- Checks owner, frozen status, and amount
- Can be called by anyone for transparency

---

## üß™ Testing the Soulbound Feature

### Test 1: Mint and Verify
```typescript
// Mint a TrustToken
await program.methods.mint(name, symbol, uri).rpc();

// Verify it's soulbound
await program.methods.verifySoulbound().rpc();
// Should succeed
```

### Test 2: Attempt Transfer
```typescript
// Try to transfer the token
await token.transfer(fromWallet, toWallet, 1);
// Should FAIL - token is frozen
```

### Test 3: Verify After Transfer Attempt
```typescript
// Verify soulbound status
await program.methods.verifySoulbound().rpc();
// Should still succeed - token didn't move
```

---

## üìù Key Differences from Original

### Before (Transferable)
```rust
// Just mint the token
mint_to(cpi_context, 1)?;
// Token can be transferred freely
```

### After (Soulbound)
```rust
// Mint the token
mint_to(cpi_context, 1)?;

// FREEZE immediately
freeze_account(freeze_cpi_context)?;
// Token is now permanently bound
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Phase 2: ReputationCard Program
- Create new Anchor program
- Implement card issuance
- Add revocation mechanism
- Link to TrustToken verification

### Phase 3: Frontend Updates
- Display soulbound status
- Show reputation cards
- Add card request functionality
- Update UI for new features

## üí° Important Notes

### Why Not Use Transfer Hooks?
- Freezing is simpler and more secure
- Transfer hooks can be bypassed
- Frozen accounts are enforced by Solana runtime
- Standard approach for soulbound tokens

### Can the Token Be Unfrozen?
- No, by design
- Freeze authority is the minter
- Minter cannot unfreeze (no function provided)
- This ensures permanent soulbound status

### What if User Loses Wallet?
- Token is lost with the wallet
- This is intentional for identity tokens
- User must mint a new token with new wallet
- Old token remains frozen in lost wallet

### Verification vs Soulbound
- **Soulbound**: Token cannot be transferred (technical)
- **Verification**: Token represents verified identity (logical)
- These are separate properties
- A token can be soulbound but not verified (revoked)
- A token cannot be verified if not soulbound

## üîç Code Changes Summary

### Added Imports
```rust
use anchor_spl::token::{
    freeze_account,  // NEW
    burn,           // NEW
    FreezeAccount,  // NEW
    Burn,           // NEW
    // ... existing imports
};
```

### Modified Functions
- `mint()` - Added freeze_account call

### New Functions
- `verify_soulbound()` - Check soulbound status
- `burn_transferred_token()` - Burn transferred tokens

### New Contexts
- `VerifySoulbound` - For verification checks
- `BurnTransferredToken` - For burning

### New Errors
- `TokenTransferred`
- `TokenNotFrozen`
- `InvalidTokenAmount`
- `TokenNotTransferred`
