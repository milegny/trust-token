### Commission Calculation

```typescript
// Determine tier
const tier = (buyerVerified && sellerVerified) 
  ? CommissionTier.PREMIUM 
  : CommissionTier.STANDARD;

// Calculate base commission
const baseRate = COMMISSION_RATES[tier]; // 0.025 or 0.04
const baseCommission = transactionAmount * baseRate;

// Apply staking discount
const stakingDiscount = transactionAmount * STAKING_DISCOUNTS[stakingTier];
const finalCommission = baseCommission - stakingDiscount;
```

### Automatic Deduction

1. Transaction initiated by buyer
2. Commission calculated based on verification status and staking tier
3. Commission automatically deducted from transaction
4. Funds distributed to treasury
5. Transaction recorded on-chain
